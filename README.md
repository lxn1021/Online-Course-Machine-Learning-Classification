# Machine Learning: Classification
## --- Online Course by University of Washington, Seattle 


I took this online course in 2018 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification). The class assignments are implemented in Python Graphlab. I think it might be a good idea to redo the assignments in Python Scikit-learn, which is more widely used in industry. Also, reproducing the same work by using another library will definitely strengthen my understanding about the course materials. So, I try to convert the "graphlab" to "sklearn" and "pandas", although most of the time they're the same.


- **Week 1 --- Linear Classifiers and Logistic Regression**

- **Week 4 --- Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees**
 
 From the course "Out of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees."

- **Week 5 --- Boosting**

From the course "One of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting."

  - **Week 6 --- Precision-Recall**
  
From the course "In many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers."
