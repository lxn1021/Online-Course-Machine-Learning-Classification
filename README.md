# Machine Learning: Classification
## --- Online Course by University of Washington, Seattle 


I took this online course in 2018 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification). The class assignments are implemented in Python Graphlab. I think it might be a good idea to redo the assignments in Python Scikit-learn, which is more widely used in industry. Also, reproducing the same work by using another library will definitely strengthen my understanding about the course materials. So, I try to convert the "graphlab" to "sklearn" and "pandas", although most of the time they're the same.


- **Week 1 --- Linear Classifiers and Logistic Regression**

From the course "Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods."
